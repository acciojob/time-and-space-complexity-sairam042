	<p>Time complexity, efficient : In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>, O(n) :The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.[1] This includes the memory space used by its inputs, called input space, and any other (auxiliary) memory it uses during execution, which is called auxiliary space.

Similar to time complexity, space complexity is often expressed asymptotically in big O notation, such as

{\displaystyle O(n\log n),}

{\displaystyle O(n^{\alpha }),}

,
{\displaystyle O(2^{n}),} etc., where n is a characteristic of the input influencing space complexity.</p>
